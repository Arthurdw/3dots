# 📈 Stock Market Simulation App

Welcome to the Stock Market Simulation App! This app is designed to allow users to simulate buying and selling stocks, add them to their watchlist, view stock details, and share their profiles with others.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is structured into two important folders: `app` and `api`.

The `app` folder contains the Android app, which was made using Kotlin.

The `api` folder contains a Hono Cloudflare Workers Edge API, which uses PlanetScale as a serverless database. The API was created using TypeScript.

## 🚀 Installation

To run the backend (the API), follow these steps:

Choose a node package manager of your choice, for example [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/).

1. Navigate to the `api` folder in your terminal.
2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager: `pnpm install`
3. Start the API: `pnpm dev`
